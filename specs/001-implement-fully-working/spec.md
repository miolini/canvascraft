# Feature Specification: MVP: Fully Working Skia Backend

**Feature Branch**: `001-implement-fully-working`  
**Created**: 2025-09-25  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Implement fully working MVP with Skia backend"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an Elixir developer, I want to draw 2D graphics to an in-memory image or file using a
stable CanvasCraft API, so that I can produce PNG output without caring about the underlying
renderer.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. Given a new canvas 800x600, When I draw a red rectangle and save as PNG, Then a PNG file
   exists and visually matches the expected image within tolerance.
2. Given a path with stroke and fill, When rendered, Then stroke joins/caps and fill rules
   match documented behavior within tolerance.
3. Given text drawing with a specified font and size, When rendered, Then glyphs appear
   correctly positioned and anti-aliased within tolerance.
4. Given transformations (translate, scale, rotate), When combined and applied, Then shapes
   render at expected coordinates.
5. Given invalid inputs (negative sizes, nil colors), When calling the API, Then a clear
   {:error, reason} is returned and no file is written.

### Edge Cases
- Extremely large canvas dimensions should return {:error, :invalid_dimensions} without crash.
- Transparent colors and alpha compositing preserve premultiplied alpha invariants.
- Floating-point rounding differences remain within configured tolerance for golden tests.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- FR-001: System MUST provide a stable functional API to create a canvas with width/height.
- FR-002: System MUST support operations: clear, fill_rect, stroke_rect, begin_path, move_to,
  line_to, bezier_to, close_path, fill, stroke.
- FR-003: System MUST support state: stroke width, cap, join, miter, fill/stroke color,
  transform stack (save/restore, translate/scale/rotate), anti-alias flag.
- FR-004: System MUST render text with font family, size, weight, alignment, and color.
- FR-005: System MUST export raster output to PNG (file path) and return binary.
- FR-006: System MUST expose a backend-agnostic API; Skia backend MUST be selectable via option.
- FR-007: System MUST include backend conformance tests that pass on Skia backend.
- FR-008: System MUST provide deterministic rendering per backend for identical inputs.
- FR-009: System MUST provide error-tolerant golden-image comparison with numeric delta.
- FR-010: System MUST provide examples/doctests that produce valid PNGs.

- FR-011: System SHOULD offer property-based tests for geometry operations.
- FR-012: System SHOULD provide basic performance benchmarks for core drawing ops.

- FR-013: System MUST adhere to the Constitution principles (idiomatic Elixir, behaviours,
  SemVer, test-first, determinism and safety).

Ambiguities to clarify:
- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Minimum supported Elixir/OTP versions]
- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Font handling baseline: system fonts only vs. bundled test fonts]
- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Exact numeric tolerance (e.g., max per-channel delta or PSNR)]
- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Target platforms for CI runners (macOS only vs macOS+Linux)]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- Canvas: width, height, background, transform stack, draw state
- Path: commands (move, line, cubic), winding rule
- Paint: color (RGBA), stroke params (width, cap, join, miter), anti-alias
- TextSpec: font family, size, weight, alignment, color
- Image: binary PNG output, file path when exported
